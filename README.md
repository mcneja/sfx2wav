sfx2wav
=======

Command-line tool to convert the audio files in the 1999 game Outcast from their "SFX" format to WAV.

The audio files use the GSM cell-phone audio compression algorithm. I found a library from Jutta Degener and Carsten Bormann for reading the format; it is included here.

I built this using Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019; project files are included.

You will need to first decompress Outcast's archive files to get at the SFX files.
